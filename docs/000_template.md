## Summary 

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Coordination/Correspondence

Please put meeting cadence and other ways to coorespond. 

## Prior art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A
few examples of what this can include are:

Does this feature exist in other ecosystems and what experience have their
community had? For other teams: What lessons can we learn from other attempts?
Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you
have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed
theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the
lessons from other implementers, provide readers of your proposal with a fuller
picture. If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to
us whether they are brand new or if they are an adaptation from other
communities.

Note that while precedent set by other communities is some motivation, it does
not on its own motivate an enhancement proposal here. Please also take into
consideration that Aries sometimes intentionally diverges from common identity
features.

## Unresolved Questions

What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the enhancement
proposal process before this gets merged? What parts of the design do you expect
to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization? What
related issues do you consider out of scope for this proposal that could be
addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
doc?
