## Summary 

A web5 fitness app for HIIT based exercises. Tabata timer is a specific timer built for HIIT exercises.
No ads. Open source. Personal use. No tracking. Free. No paywall. Own your workout data with a web5 based tabata timer.

## Motivation

I have used the other apps in the market, but I wanted to make something better for my self. Fitness apps are a great use case for web5.

## Coordination/Correspondence

DIF Slack for now. 

## Prior art

Tabata Timer: Interval Timer -- The main app on the app store. 5M+ downloads. 
This is hidden behind a paywall, has ads, is not open source. We can do better.
It's farther along, and has been worked on longer, but I hope that in time this app is going to clearly be better than that app.

[Web5 Tabata Timer](https://github.com/andorsk/web5-tabata-timer) -- My app I've put together last few days and will continue to work on. 

## Unresolved Questions

I may want to expand scope over time. Right now it's simple. A timer that is a PWA that I can run anywhere. 
As time moves on, I would consider adding more scope.

## Outputs

- Minimally, a Web5 Protocol Design For Excercise Routines and Sharing
- Possibly some code. To discuss.
